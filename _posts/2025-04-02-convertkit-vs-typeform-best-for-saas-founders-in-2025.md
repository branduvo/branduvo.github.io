### ConvertKit vs Typeform: Key Differences

While both ConvertKit and Typeform serve as powerful tools for SaaS businesses, their core functionalities are different. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the major differences:

#### 1. **Purpose & Use Cases**
- **ConvertKit:** Primarily an email marketing automation platform, ConvertKit is ideal for SaaS businesses that need to manage their email lists, nurture leads, and create automated email campaigns. It’s a perfect tool for building and maintaining relationships with customers and prospects.
- **Typeform:** Typeform excels at data collection through surveys, forms, and quizzes. It's best suited for gathering customer feedback, conducting market research, and engaging users with interactive forms.
