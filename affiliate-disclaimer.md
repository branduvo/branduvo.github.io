<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>At Branduvo, transparency is important to us. To maintain trust with our audience, we want to disclose that some of the links on our website are affiliate links. This means we may earn a small commission if you make a purchase through these links, at no additional cost to you.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-affiliate-links">What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
<p>Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow merchants to identify the source of a referral. When you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, the merchant pays a commission to us as a thank-you for referring you to their product or service.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-use-affiliate-links">Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
<p>Affiliate links help support the ongoing operation of Branduvo. The commissions we earn enable us to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain and improve the quality of our website and content.</li>
  <li>Provide free resources, tools, and recommendations to our audience.</li>
  <li>Cover operational costs without relying on intrusive ads.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="editorial-integrity">Editorial Integrity</h2>
<p>Our recommendations are based on extensive research, testing, and real-world experience. While we may earn a commission from affiliate links, our reviews and opinions are unbiased and not influenced by compensation. We only recommend products or services that we genuinely believe add value to our audience.</p>

<h2 id="your-trust-matters">Your Trust Matters</h2>
<p>We are committed to being transparent about how we earn income. We encourage you to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@branduvo.com">info@branduvo.com</a> if you have any questions about our affiliate partnerships or recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="how-affiliate-links-impact-you">How Affiliate Links Impact You</h2>
<p>Clicking on an affiliate link does not change the price you pay for a product or service. The price remains the same whether you use our link or go directly to the merchantâ€™s website.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-this-disclaimer">Changes to This Disclaimer</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to update this Affiliate Disclaimer at any time. Updates will be reflected on this page with an updated "Effective Date."</p>
